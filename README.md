# Musical-curvature
this project is based on the method of imaging chords triads with respect to minor and seventh chords as [X,Y,Z] coordinates and calculating thier curvature .
this is a topic which we research as a group trying to find connection between the images that were created. 
we try to look for any patterns and ask ourselves what could be concluded from their shapes by implying mathmatical tricks and geometric analysis.
