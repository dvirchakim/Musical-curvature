# Examples Directory

This directory contains well-documented example analyses demonstrating various aspects of musical curvature analysis.

## Available Examples

### 1. `basic_visualization.py`
A simple example showing how to visualize a basic chord progression in 3D space.

**Concepts covered:**
- Setting up 3D plots
- Plotting chord positions
- Drawing progression paths

### 2. `curvature_calculation.py`
Demonstrates how to calculate and interpret curvature values.

**Concepts covered:**
- Using the TwoDimCurvCalc function
- Comparing different progressions
- Interpreting results

### 3. `multi_section_analysis.py`
Shows how to analyze and compare different sections of a song.

**Concepts covered:**
- Multiple plot figures
- Section comparison
- Color coding by section

## Running the Examples

```bash
cd examples
python basic_visualization.py
python curvature_calculation.py
python multi_section_analysis.py
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with `basic_visualization.py` to understand the visualization
2. Move to `curvature_calculation.py` to learn about metrics
3. Try `multi_section_analysis.py` for more complex analysis
4. Experiment with your own songs!

## Tips

- Modify the coordinate values to see how the visualization changes
- Try different color schemes
- Experiment with different curvature calculations
- Compare your results with the main song files
